# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## I. Overview of Project

### Background
Becks is a data scientist for Alphabet Soup, a non profit foundation who has raised and donated over $10B in the last 20 years. We worked together with Becks to analyze the impact of each donation and vet potential recipients to help ensure that the foundations money is being used effectively. This will predict which organizations are worth donating to and which are high risk. The plan is to create a mathematical, data driven solution that can do this accurately using a deep learning neural network.

### Objective
From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Using machine learning and neural networks, we will use the dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
